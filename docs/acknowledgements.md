This software greatly benefited from funding provided to [Jamie
Oaks](http://www.phyletica.com) from the National Science Foundation (DEB
1011423 and DBI 1308885), University of Kansas (KU) Office of Graduate Studies,
Society of Systematic Biologists, Sigma Xi Scientific Research Society, KU
Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department, and the KU Biodiversity Institute.

Some of the functions for calculating properties of Dirichlet processes were
adapted from functions within `util.h` from the software package
[`DPPDiv`](http://phylo.bio.ku.edu/content/tracy-heath-dppdiv) version 1.0b
