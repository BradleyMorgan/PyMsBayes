Background

Biogeographers often seek to explain diversity on historical events.
That is, using genetic data from contemporary populations, we would like to
infer diversification patterns and see if they support patterns predicted by
past event(s) of interest.
For example if at some point in the past an event split a community of species,
we might expect to find divergences across multiple pairs of populations
co-distributed across the barrier would be temporally clustered, as shown
in the shared_divergence_ figure.
