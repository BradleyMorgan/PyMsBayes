Version 0.2.2
=============

Changes
-------
  - End-user CLI scripts log additional information.
  - ``dmc.py`` will now set the number of standardizing samples equal to the
    number of prior samples, if the former is larger than the latter.

New Features
------------
  - New management of paths to dpp-msbayes and msBayes executables. Previously,
    the package only used the executables bundled with the package, which
    required the package to be installed via ``python setup.py develop``. Now,
    the package will also look for executables on the system.
  - Updating ``setup.py`` so that the bundled executables will be installed
    along with end-user scripts via ``python setup.py install`` after checking
    that all the executables work on the system.
  - 32-bit Linux versions of the dpp-msbayes/msBayes executables are now
    bundled with the package.

Bug Fixes
---------
  - Fixed a bug where ``MsBayesWorker`` instances with a sample size of zero
    would hang indefinitely. A ValueError is now raised if an ``MsBayesWorder``
    is initiated with an integer less than one for the sample size.


Version 0.2.1
=============

Changes
-------
  - Adding working version of documentation.
  - Overhauled package-wide and CLI-script logging management.

Bug Fixes
---------
  - Fixing bug in ``dmc.py`` script, where the wrong value for the number of
    standardizing samples was being written to the run summary file.


Version 0.2.0
=============

New Features
------------
  - New options added to package and scripts for the sort index. These allow
    summary statistics to be grouped by taxon, but without re-sorting.

Changes
-------
  - The new default option for the sort index for the entire package and for
    end-user scripts is to not group or re-sort the summary statistics of each
    alignment. The re-sorting that was done prior to this was NOT VALID,
    because the summary statics calculated from the different alignments are
    NOT exchangeable.
