Version 0.3.4
=============

Changes
-------

-   Making 'pretty' summary output of ``dmc_posterior_probs.py`` script more
    robust. The regex used by ``ListConditionEvaluator`` to put the names of
    the taxon pairs into the expression was easily fooled by numbers included
    in the names. This did not affect the results, but led confusing summary
    output. This is now more robust, and the output messages should now help
    rather than confuse.


Version 0.3.3
=============

Changes
-------

-   If 'nan' observed summary statistics are produced, an error is raised to
    crash the analysis early on. This can happen for some summary statistics
    when there are populations with only a single sequence sampled.


Version 0.3.2
=============

New Features
------------

-   New documentation.
-   New tutorials.
-   A new option ``timeInSubsPerSite`` is now supported for dpp-msbayes and
    msbayes analyses.
-   The coefficient of variation of divergence times is now reported.
-   The ``dmc_dpp_summary.py`` CLI script now estimates and reports the
    probabilities of the number of categoories.
-   New ``dmc_sum_sims.py`` CLI script for summarizing and plotting the results
    of simulation-based analyses.
-   New "-m/--mu" option added to ``dmc_plot_results.py`` script for specifying
    the mutation rate to rescale time to generations.
-   New "--extension" option added to ``dmc_plot_results.py`` script to allow
    the file format of the plots to be specified.
-   Adding new worker classes to the API for simulating data via Joseph Heled's
    ``biopy`` package.
-   Adding ``DppSimWorker`` and ``DppSimTeam`` to the API.

Changes
-------

-   More rigorous checks added to ``dmc.py`` to make sure all the sample tables
    are the same within an analysis.
-   The logging frequency is now in units of prior samples rather than batch
    iterations.
-   Help menus of CLI scripts have been updated.
-   New dpp-msbayes executables were added that accommodate the
    ``timeInSubsPerSite`` option and reporting the coefficient of variation of
    divergence times.
-   The package has been updated to handle these new options.
-   For the ``dmc_plot_results.py`` CLI script, changing the the
    ``--iteration-index`` option to ``--sample-index`` to reflect the new
    logging behavior (units of prior samples rather than batch iterations).


Version 0.3.1
=============

Changes
-------
-   Cleaning up intra-package imports and rearranging some of the code.


Version 0.3.0
=============

Changes
-------
-   Updated the version of ``dpp-msprior`` binary (for both mac and linux) that
    is bundled with the package. This version of ``dpp-msprior`` is from
    version 0.2 of the ``dpp-msbayes`` package and was updated to create a
    lower limit (0.000000000001) for values of theta. In rare cases, a theta
    value of zero would cause the coalescent simulator ``msDQH`` to crash.
    Any previous analyses that did not crash should not be affected by
    this change.
-   The newer version of ``dpp-msprior`` also changes the weirdness from the
    original ``msBayes`` where there was a check for small (i.e., 0.0001)
    divergence times. In such simulations, the div time was set to this
    arbitrary lower bound, and the bottleneck time was set to 0.5 of this.  I
    am guessing this was to prevent unrealistic (and numerically unstable?)
    changes in pop size. However, 0.0001 can be thousands of generations which
    is not trivial. Also, rather than this weird hack of the bottleneck time,
    it seems much better to simply have no bottleneck if the div time is
    essentially zero. Accordingly, I lowered the threshold and simply "turn
    off" the bottleneck if the time is below it (I no longer adjust the div
    time or bottleneck time). This change should have very little affect on
    most analyses.

Bug Fixes
---------
-   As mentioned in the change above, in rare cases, theta values of zero drawn
    from the prior via ``dpp-msprior`` would cause ``msDQH`` to crash. The new
    version of the ``dpp-msprior`` binaries should prevent this. Any previous
    analyses that did not crash were not affected by this bug.


Version 0.2.2
=============

Changes
-------
-   End-user CLI scripts log additional information.
-   ``dmc.py`` will now set the number of standardizing samples equal to the
    number of prior samples, if the former is larger than the latter.

New Features
------------
-   New management of paths to dpp-msbayes and msBayes executables. Previously,
    the package only used the executables bundled with the package, which
    required the package to be installed via ``python setup.py develop``. Now,
    the package will also look for executables on the system.
-   Updating ``setup.py`` so that the bundled executables will be installed
    along with end-user scripts via ``python setup.py install`` after checking
    that all the executables work on the system.
-   32-bit Linux versions of the dpp-msbayes/msBayes executables are now
    bundled with the package.

Bug Fixes
---------
-   Fixed a bug where ``MsBayesWorker`` instances with a sample size of zero
    would hang indefinitely. A ValueError is now raised if an ``MsBayesWorder``
    is initiated with an integer less than one for the sample size.


Version 0.2.1
=============

Changes
-------
-   Adding working version of documentation.
-   Overhauled package-wide and CLI-script logging management.

Bug Fixes
---------
-   Fixing bug in ``dmc.py`` script, where the wrong value for the number of
    standardizing samples was being written to the run summary file.


Version 0.2.0
=============

New Features
------------
-   New options added to package and scripts for the sort index. These allow
    summary statistics to be grouped by taxon, but without re-sorting.

Changes
-------
-   The new default option for the sort index for the entire package and for
    end-user scripts is to not group or re-sort the summary statistics of each
    alignment. The re-sorting that was done prior to this was NOT VALID,
    because the summary statics calculated from the different alignments are
    NOT exchangeable.
